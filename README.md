# GSX
GameStation X. The last of a generation.

To cap off a generation of enjoyment, we have put one last console in the line of GameStations.

The GSX is going to be the final console in the GameStation line.
We hope it brings as much enjoyment as the other consoles did.

Plans:

• Shiny design

• GSN?

• GS2 Compatibility or some shiet

• A clean, nice menu

• GAMES

• Some cool apps

See "latestbuild" for info on the latest builds of GSX.
